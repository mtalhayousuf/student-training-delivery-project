### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
- Data loading and inspection.
- Handling missing values.
- Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the training data to answer key questions, such as:

- How many courses are students completing within the bootcamp?
- What is the overall student satisfaction level with course materials and instructors?
- How does satisfaction vary across different cohorts?
- What is the progress rate of each cohort throughout the bootcamp?
- Are there any patterns or trends in student engagement and course completion?
